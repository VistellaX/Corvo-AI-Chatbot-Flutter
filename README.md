# corvo_ai_chatbot

The current version of this chatbot uses the Dart language with the Flutter framework, ensuring a more pleasant visual experience. It's an old, outdated project with obsolete libraries.

The character uses Google's Gemini AI.

The Chatbot's features include:
- contextual memory;
- enhanced responses based on PDF files that the user attaches to knowledge sources;
- context removal;
- deleting or editing messages from the conversation, which allows for fine-tuning the bot's responses and personality.

This is a source code demo for a personal project focused on developing a unique character.

NOTE: Developed for Android only.
